# Staircases

One curious child has a set of N little bricks (5 ≤ N ≤ 500). From these bricks
he builds different staircases. Staircase consists of steps of different sizes
in a strictly descending order. It is not allowed for staircase to have steps
equal sizes. Every staircase consists of at least two steps and each step
contains at least one brick.

Your task is to write a program that reads the number N and writes the only
number Q — amount of different staircases that can be built from exactly N
bricks.
