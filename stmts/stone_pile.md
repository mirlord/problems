# Stone pile

You have a number of stones with known weights w1, …, wn. Write a program that
will rearrange the stones into two piles such that weight difference between
the piles is minimal.

**Input**

Input contains the number of stones n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and weights of the stones
w1, …, wn (integers, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100000) delimited by white spaces.

**Output**

Your program should output a number representing the minimal possible weight
difference between stone piles.

## Example

**Input**

    5
    5 8 13 27 14

**Output**

    3
