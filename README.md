# Programming problems solutions

Here lies a set of my solutions for some programming problems.

Used languages (in a descending usage frequency order):
* erlang
* clojure
* java

## Disclaimer

I do not guarantee, that:
* these solutions are the best by code readability and/or execution performance;
* these solutions are even correct (but I hope they are);
* and anything else you may assume but it's not excplicitly guaranteed here.

## Contribution

I dont think anybody will make such attempts, but anyway please do NOT try to
contribute to this repository. There are my solutions, not anybody's else.
